# Technical Workflow


- To compile the entire project, run "mvn install".

- To run the application, run "mvn spring-boot:run" and open http://localhost:8888/yocojack-portal/

- change productionMode to true in the servlet class configuration (nested in the UI class)
- run "mvn clean package"
- test the war file with

## Client-Side compilation


The generated maven project is using an automatically generated widgetset by default. 
When you add a dependency that needs client-side compilation, the maven plugin will 
automatically generate it for you. Your own client-side customizations can be added into
package "client".

Debugging client side code
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application
